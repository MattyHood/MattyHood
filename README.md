# Early-Career Data Scientist | Python | Machine Learning | Automation

Hi, I'm **Matty** — an early-career Data Scientist with hands-on experience in:

- Machine learning (classification & regression)
- Python ETL automation (Outlook → Excel → SQL)
- Forecasting & analytics
- Stakeholder-facing dashboards (Power BI)
- Building modular tools and reusable ML pipelines

I’m passionate about using data to solve real problems, automate repetitive workflows, and build clean, maintainable analytical tools.

## Featured Projects

### **PDSS — Python Data Science Summary Tools**
A modular ML toolkit with reusable pipelines for:

- classification & regression  
- cross-validation, ROC-AUC evaluation  
- model diagnostics & optimisation  
- feature checks (correlation, VIF)

**A real miniature Python library** built to streamline DS workflows.
